##### Cython
 * system allows coders to mix Python and C-like code.                                                                                   
##### The Jython 
 * Java-based implementation, and the                                                                                      
##### IronPython
 * .NET-based implementation provide alternative ways to script components.                                                                              
##### Data base
 * There are Python interfaces to all commonly used
relational database systems—Sybase, Oracle, Informix, ODBC, MySQL, PostgreSQL SQLite, and more.*

---
#### What is your favorite color?
#### What are the six main reasons that people choose to use Python?
 * Software quality, developer productivity, program portability, support libraries,
component integration, and simple enjoyment. Of these, the quality and produc-
tivity themes seem to be the main reasons that people choose to use Python

---
#### Some notable companies or organizations using Python today.
 * Google, Industrial Light & Magic, CCP Games, Jet Propulsion Labs, Maya, ESRI,
and  many  more.  Almost  every  organization  doing  software  development  uses
Python in some fashion, whether for long-term strategic product development or
for short-term tactical tasks such as testing and system administration.
---
#### Why you  might not want to use Python in an application? 
 * Python’s main downside is performance: it won’t run as quickly as fully compiled
languages like C and C++. On the other hand, it’s quick enough for most appli-
cations, and typical Python code runs at close to C speed anyhow because it invokes
linked-in C code in the interpreter. If speed is critical, compiled extensions are
available for number-crunching parts of an application.
---
#### What can you do with Python?
 * You can use Python for nearly anything you can do with a computer, from website development and gaming to robotics and spacecraft control.


#### Why does “spam” show up in so many Python examples in books and on the Web?
 * “Spam” is a reference from a famous Monty Python skit in which people trying to order food in a cafeteria are drowned out by a chorus of Vikings singing about spam. Oh, and it’s also a common variable name in Python scripts

---
#### How to start an interactive interpreter session? 
 
#### Where do you type a system command line to launch a script file? 
---

#### Four or more ways to run the code saved in a script file.
 * Code in a script (really, module) file can be run with system command lines, file icon clicks, imports and reloads, the exec built-in function, and IDE GUI selections such as IDLE’s Run → Run Module menu option. 
 * On Unix, they can also be run as executables with the #! trick, and some platforms support more specialized launching techniques (e.g., drag and drop).                                                                                                                                                                  
 * In addition, some text editors have unique ways to run Python code, some Python programs are provided as standalone “fro-zen binary” executables, and some systems use Python code in embedded mode,where it is run automatically by an enclosing program written in a language like C, C++, or Java. The latter technique is usually done to provide a user customization layer.

#### pitfalls related to clicking file icons on Windows.
Scripts that print and then exit cause the output file to disappear immediately,
before you can view the output (which is why the input trick comes in handy);
error messages generated by your script also appear in an output window that
closes before you can examine its contents (which is one reason that system com-
mand lines and IDEs such as IDLE are better for most development).
---

#### How do you run a script from within IDLE?
 * Within the text edit window of the file you wish to run, select the window’s Run→Run Module menu option. This runs the window’s source code as a top-level script file and displays its output back in the interactive Python shell window.
---
#### Name two pitfalls related to using IDLE.
 * IDLE can still be hung by some types of programs—especially GUI programs that perform multithreading (an advanced technique beyond this book’s scope).
 * IDLE has some usability features that can burn you once you leave the IDLE GUI:a script’s variables are automatically imported to the interactive scope in IDLE and working directories are changed when you run a file, for instance, but Python itself does not take such steps in general
