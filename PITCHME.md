##### Cython
 * system allows coders to mix Python and C-like code.                                                                                   
##### The Jython 
 * Java-based implementation, and the   
##### IronPython
 * .NET-based implementation provide alternative ways to script components.    
 ---
##### Data base
 * There are Python interfaces to all commonly used
relational database systems—Sybase, Oracle, Informix, ODBC, MySQL, PostgreSQL SQLite, and more.*

---
#### What is your favorite color?
#### What are the six main reasons that people choose to use Python?
 * Software quality, developer productivity, program portability, support libraries,
component integration, and simple enjoyment. Of these, the quality and produc-
tivity themes seem to be the main reasons that people choose to use Python

---
#### Some notable companies or organizations using Python today.
 * Google, Industrial Light & Magic, CCP Games, Jet Propulsion Labs, Maya, ESRI,
and  many  more.  Almost  every  organization  doing  software  development  uses
Python in some fashion, whether for long-term strategic product development or
for short-term tactical tasks such as testing and system administration.
---
#### Why you  might not want to use Python in an application? 
 * Python’s main downside is performance: it won’t run as quickly as fully compiled
languages like C and C++. On the other hand, it’s quick enough for most appli-
cations, and typical Python code runs at close to C speed anyhow because it invokes
linked-in C code in the interpreter. If speed is critical, compiled extensions are
available for number-crunching parts of an application.
---
#### What can you do with Python?
 * You can use Python for nearly anything you can do with a computer, from website development and gaming to robotics and spacecraft control.
